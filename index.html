        <p>Godzilla (Gojira), also dubbed Titanus Gojira, is a giant reptilian daikaiju created by Legendary Pictures that first appeared in the 2014 film, Godzilla.
            Following this, Godzilla appeared briefly in the post-credits scene of the 2017 film, Kong: Skull Island, making a cameo appearance as two cave paintings and roaring as the film ends.
            Godzilla reappears in the 2019 sequel, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, where he encounters Rodan, Mothra, Ghidorah, and several other Titans.
            Following 2019's monstrous clash, Godzilla met and faced off against Kong before they ended up combating and teaming up against Mechagodzilla in the 2021 film, Godzilla vs. Kong.</p>

            2014 design.
           
            
            
            For the return of Godzilla, it was decided to give the King of the Monsters a newly revamped look. Thus, he was given a new design that did not look radically different from the established Godzilla designs like the TriStar Godzilla design from the 1998 film did, but like the TriStar design, it was intended to have a more realistic approach. Just like the 2007 Godzilla design, this design is completely computer-generated. Lead creature and concept designer Matt Allsopp and WETA Workshop creature designers Andrew Baker, Christian Pearce, and Greg Broadmore were tasked with bringing Godzilla into a contemporary reality while honoring his classic silhouette.
            for 2014 Godzilla,The King, ,for his design, his face is blocky, its neck is broad and has shark-like gills, making this the first Godzilla design to feature gills. His eyes are small with a golden-yellow color, and his teeth are small and not nearly as straightly lined up as in previous Godzilla designs. The head and neck seem to lean forward more and the nostrils are more separate, being on opposite sides of the snout, and making him more reptile-like instead of the more mammalian fashion of being close together in the front compared to past designs. According to Andrew Baker, the filmmakers studied the faces of dogs, bears, and eagles to make His face look noble and majestic, yet not too cute or threatening.
            for Godzilla, his designed dorsal plates are smaller than the previous designs, but they still retain the core maple-leaf shape, although straighter and very sharp, somewhat like MireGoji, creating a more jagged look when rising from the water. Godzilla, well his claws are black, and his feet are wider, resembling a foot of an elephant, with larger claws than the other Godzilla designs. His skin is more reptilian and crocodile-like, and rougher than the other designs, and is a very dark gray (almost black) color. His body and tail are very wide as well, making him look somewhat bulkier than other Godzilla designs.
            Legendary confirmed that their Godzilla has a tail, that is is 550 feet | or 270 meters | and 4 inches long, his height is 355 feet | or 108 meters | there are exactly 89 dorsal plates running down his back, the palm of his hands are 34 feet and 4 inches each, and that his roar can be heard from 3 miles away, loud enough to make an opponent go deaf.

            2019 - 2021 design.
        
        

            While retaining the same basic design as his 2014 appearance, Godzilla received a slight revamp for King of the Monsters, with his dorsal plates changing in shape. Instead of being jagged and straighter in design, the new design features more protrusions. The three large central dorsal plates running from mid-way down his back are the same shape as the original Godzilla dorsal plates. The claws of his toes are also longer and curved. His skin is rougher in texture. The tip of his tail is also more rounded. His eye color remains the same color, but it will change when he uses his atomic powers, becoming bright blue or yellow-orange, much like his attacks. In his burning form, he has orange markings around his body similar to Godzilla Earth,His scarlet form as well as orange eyes with the texture of red. He has a height from 393 feet |or 120 meters| and a length from 582 feet |or 300 meters|.

         2021 - 2022 design.

            In Godzilla vs. Kong, His physical design largely has not changed. Adam Wingard liked the update done by Mike Dougherty with the maple leaf design of the dorsal fins. However, he did contemplate making his head a little bigger but decided against it as to keep the visual consistency of the character that audiences recognized from the previous film.

            Now grown to almost 400-feet tall, Godzilla stands as king of all he surveys. Initially thought to be a threat, we now understand his potential to become the ultimate guardian of Earth, a towering apex predator emerging from the mysterious depths of the ocean to battle aggressors that threaten the balance of nature.

            The creature designated Titanus Gojira draws its immense power from a bio-nuclear circulatory system that activates when threatened, triggering a neutron flux that travels up its shard-like backspines to nucleosynthetic throat chambers where it explodes into a directed wave of atomic breath. Through this remarkable process, His roar itself becomes nature’s most devastating weapon.

            The Monarch facility designated |Castle Bravo| was built specifically as a flagship underwater observation base by Monarch to study Godzilla in his natural habitat. Our findings so far have been hard-earned but revelatory. Sub-aquatic audio captures suggest the creature utilizes a range of communication frequencies more complex than anything we had imagined. When not enraged into action, the creature is slow, graceful, inquisitive even.

            His size and radioactive signature make him easy to monitor, with scans showing him traveling through various oceanic channels on routine patrol routes propelled by his massive tail. There are sporadic gaps where his signature disappears from tracking logs, and analytics is working closely with our mythography team to determine the cause. The Dr. Brooks |Hollow Earth| theory is gaining more traction because of this finding and is currently leading the on-going investigation. It is possible that the epicenter of these sightings is proximal to a previously undiscovered vile vortex.</h1>

        <h1>Personality


            | The top of the primordial ecosystem. A god, for all intents and purposes. |

            _ Vivienne Graham.


            In Godzilla, The behavior of Godzilla is that of a territorial animal, Ishiro Serizawa theorized that Godzilla is the driving force to restore balance to nature whenever that balance is disrupted, suggesting that he essentially considers the entire Earth to be his territory.

            However, unlike previous incarnations, Godzilla doesn't blatantly attack or plow through ships at sea simply because they are there, in fact, with larger ships like aircraft carriers, he simply dives under them, even when the military launched a combined forces assault to stop him, he did not react or fight back, and simply continued to hunt the MUTOs, even when he was being flanked by four naval ships. As opposed to any sort of morality, it appears to be that he simply considers humans to be tiny and insignificant and does not care about their general well-being but at the same time does not consider them worth destroying even though they, without harming him at all, fire at him nonstop.

            Godzilla does not seem to destroy on purpose, even when he destroyed the Golden Gate Bridge, it did not appear to be intentional, but just him reacting from being hit in the gills by explosives. He displays little interest in humans and focuses his attention entirely on the MUTOs. His supposed disinterest in the well-being of humans may be caused by their repeated attempts to kill him, the same attempt that showcased their destructive capabilities. After defeating both MUTOs, he leaves humans alone without any more conflict.

            However, Godzilla does occasionally display signs of advanced thinking, as he is seen adapting his strategies to fight the MUTOs and even uses sleight-of-hand to trick the male MUTO into approaching his tail, which he uses to impale him on a fallen skyscraper. He appears to possess some degree of emotion as he briefly looks Ford Brody in the eye when he collapses to his level, which also could suggest that he has at least some degree of interest in humans.

            Godzilla was designed to have a personality that would evoke the |Last Samurai| archetype, an ancient warrior content with solitude and preferring not to be a part of the world but has to resurface when certain types of events force him to appear and set things right.

            His most notable relationships with other Titans are with MUTOs, Mothra, Ghidorah, and Kong. With Mothra, they are true allies, more so than their past incarnations that were prone to be at odds with each other since their species have symbiotic relationships with one another. Mothra,her undying loyalty towards Godzilla is best demonstrated when she assists him in their fight against Ghidorah and Rodan, using her webs to glue Ghidorah onto a skyscraper, and incapacitating Rodan after he fought her. Their ancient alliance had been defined in romantic terms, with Dr. Ilene Chen calling Mothra |Queen of the Monsters| and Chief Warrant Officer Jackson Barnes questioning if |they got a thing going on|, though subsequently Dr. Sam Coleman clarifying it as a |symbiotic relationship|. As she died, Godzilla roared in grief while he absorbed her life-force, allowing him to go thermonuclear and vaporized Ghidorah. Following the battle, Godzilla had not forgotten the sacrifice of Mothra, and her gift of life led him to find a new home.

            Godzilla perceived MUTOs as uneasy ally at best through Queen MUTO who submits to him as her alpha and both deadly pests and natural enemy at worst through the conflict with MUTO couple he killed at San Fransisco and MUTO Prime. Lastly, in the case of Ghidorah and Kong, the two are Godzilla's fierce rivals as shown in various cave paintings where he is depicted fighting alternatively with one of them for different reasons; whereas with the former, their feud could be best described as the battle between light and darkness owing to the extraterrestrial Titans,their malicious nature and desire to lay waste upon Earth, Godzilla and Kong battled each other because of their species' long-standing rivalry, but the two nevertheless willing to put aside their difference in facing a common threat. After defeating Mechagodzilla together, the two make amends to each other and went on separate ways on better terms.

            When Godzilla becomes the alpha again after defeating Ghidorah, he does not attack the other Titans who followed Ghidorah and instead spares them when they swear their allegiance to him again. During his rule, Godzilla works to keep his fellow Titans from causing chaos and submit some who defy him, like Scylla and Tiamat. He also starts to care for the well-being of the human race and seeks the balance between both kinds, as evidenced by a clipping in the end credits mentioning that Godzilla is keeping the other Titans from attacking major human settlements. However, he also attacked some Titan traffickers that were trying to capture Na Kika. Ultimately, he sends all the Titans to hibernation, deciding that maintaining all of them under control was too much for him to handle.

            In Godzilla vs. Kong, Godzilla revealed to possess the capacity to become aggressive and violent towards humans and Titans alike if he is provoked, something Madison Russell acknowledged as it was not his nature to wreak havoc upon human settlements without cause or reason. He wreaked havoc upon the facilities of Apex Cybernetics upon sensing that its human occupants were hiding what he senses is an alpha that was challenging him |the new ORCA was making alpha calls| that Godzilla calls the Hidden One. Godzilla eventually faces the one he calls |the Hidden One| in the form of the destructive, out-of-control Mecha-godzilla⁠, influenced by the remains of Ghidorah grafted into its systems, and would have continued what the extraterrestrial Titan started had he and Kong failed to stop it.

            Godzilla, his mission to eliminate the threat came into the conflict of Kong, who⁠ though having nothing to do with the resurgence⁠ of Ghidorah - is an example of the willingness of Godzilla to eliminate those who oppose him from his goal, in addition to the conflicts of their races past conflicts. While he displayed brutal and prideful tendencies when fighting Kong at Hong Kong, as he gave of a particularly menacing grin followed by a grumble evocative of a chuckle of sorts when he singed the back of Kong with his atomic breath, His confrontation with Kong was partly due to frustration by his rival unknowingly deterring him from stopping Apex Cybernetics twice. However, this didn't stop him from sparing the ape-like Titan's life since the latter was not the threat he sought and to a subtle degree, Kong's defiance in the face of defeat earning him the respect of the King Of The Monsters. This noble decision ultimately saved his life during a hopeless fight against Mechagodzilla, since it allows Kong to assist his likely ally against a common enemy. </h1>

        <h1>


            Since the Godzilla roar is considered one of the most famous sound effects in film history, sound designers Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van Der Ryn were both tasked with paying homage to it while revamping it and creating something new.

            According to Edwards, they spent six months over the three-year production experimenting with different techniques such as a pine tar-coated leather glove on a double bass trying to match the initial metallic shriek, the following wail, and the finishing bellow of Godzilla's iconic roar. Using microphones that could record sound inaudible to human ears, the team recorded hundreds of sounds at a 192 kHz sample rate before slowing them down to an audible range until they stumbled upon the combination that gave them goosebumps.

            The final version that was created was the 50th the team produced. The pair tested the roar on a backlot at Warner Bros., using a 100,000-watt tour speaker array for The Rolling Stones. The roar was powerful enough to rattle pipes and rooftops and was estimated that it could be heard up to three miles away. For this experiment, the crew sent out fliers to surrounding communities warning the neighbors about the potential sound disruption; despite these preemptive measures, however, Burbank P.D. started getting calls and people were tweeting |Godzilla's at my apartment door!| Additionally, Godzilla can make sounds other than roaring, best demonstrated after killing the male MUTO, and when he collapses to Ford's level, he growls in a soft way that sounds similar to a cat purring.

            In an interview with Mike Dougherty, he revealed that even though he thinks the crew did a great job revamping Godzilla's roar, he pushed them further to bring it even closer to the original 1954 Godzilla roar. The latest version of the roar measures 174 decibels. The final version of Godzilla's roar is overlaid with the roars from both the 1954 film and the roars used from 1962 to 1975.

            In Godzilla vs. Kong, the Godzilla roar from the 2012 Comic-Con teaser and a variation of his extended roar from the main trailer of the 2014 film was used in the film. the roar of Godzilla from the Heisei era can be faintly heard when he was ambushed by Kong during their fight in Hong Kong.

        Godzilla is portrayed through CGI and keyframe animation, with a partial motion-capture performance from T.J. Storm. Andy Serkis, who performed motion capture for Kong in the Peter Jackson 2005 remake, was consulted to make the Legendary Godzilla and the MUTOs computer-generated movements more realistic.

            VFX supervisor Jim Rygiel said that the fighting style of this Godzilla was based on those of bears and Komodo dragons as they stand up tall and barge their opponents backward with their arms. In the film, Godzilla is seen doing this with the female MUTO. According to Moving Picture Company VFX supervisor Guillaume Rocheron, Godzilla's movements were also inspired by lions and wolves. This incarnation of Godzilla was designed to be as biologically plausible and |realistic| as possible, with the design process being to try and imagine what Godzilla would look like as a believable, real, natural animal.</h1>
